# MODULE 19 Challenge 
# CryptoClustering - Unsupervised Machine Learning Challenge
## Patricia Daher
Using Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze cryptocurrency market data. The goal is to group cryptocurrencies based on their 24-hour and 7-day price changes and compare clustering results before and after dimensionality reduction.

### Data Preparation and Processing
K-Means Clustering with PCA: Workflow (Past Tense)
1. Data Preparation
Loaded and explored the dataset (crypto_market_data.csv).
Normalized the data using StandardScaler().
Set coin_id as the index.

2. Optimal K (Elbow Method)
Computed inertia for k = 1 to 11.
Plotted the inertia values and determined the best k.

3. K-Means Clustering
Fit the K-Means model and predicted clusters.
Visualized results with hvPlot (for both original and PCA-transformed data).

4. PCA Analysis
Reduced features to 3 principal components using PCA.
Calculated the total explained variance.

5. Comparative Visualization
Overlaid elbow curves (original vs. PCA data).
Analyzed the impact of PCA on clustering (e.g., cluster separation, optimal k).

6. Key Questions Answered
Identified the best k value for the original data.
Reported the total explained variance of the three principal components.
Evaluated whether PCA changed the optimal k.
Assessed how reducing features affected clustering results.
